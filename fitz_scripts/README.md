# Miscellaneous tools 

This directory contains scripts written by Fitz, data produced by her pipeline, and my miscellaneous scripts for working with output from Fitz' barcode analysis output. 

There is also a Jupyter notebook for the downstream analyses, but this has been superceded by the RMarkdown in the top directory of this repo: [../analyze_barcode_hamming.Rmd](../analyze_barcode_hamming.Rmd)
