## Synopsis

The following is an enumeration of distinct viral barcode sequences, taking into account read quality and considering the subsets defined by different samples (mosquito midguts), cells (cell barcode or whitelist), and UMIs (unique molecular identifiers). However, many distinct viral barcodes are attached to the same UMI with the same cell.
This observation is unexpected and, at the time of writing, an anomalous observation that we consider unreliable until better understood.  We can detect these anomalies by counting how many distinct viral sequences a UMI maps to within cells, and if this number is greater than 1, all reads for that midgut/cell/UMI combination are discarded.

## Conclusion

In this dataset, the anomalous UMI/viral barcode sequences do not provide reliable evidence that more than one virus can infect a single cell. The phenomenon occurs at the highest quality standard (37), so cannot be attributed to base calling errors in the sequencing. Until the anomaly is explained, these observations must be filtered from the analysis, leaving few cases of deduplicated reads that indicate a distinct viral origin (ranging from 0 cases to 23 in different midgut samples).  This analysis ignores some considerations. First, there may be evidence outside of the viral barcode that two distinct sequences share a UMI. If that is happening, the number of reliable counts would decrease further. Second, we did not evaluate whether this result is expected by UMI collision. However, an 11 base-pair UMI can have 4,194,304 unique sequences, far outnumbering the number of reads captured for a given cell.  In conclusion, without being able to account for distinct sequences sharing a UMI in this dataset, we are unable to reliably observe viral diversity in a cell.

# Data 

There are 7 samples (West Nile virus infested mosquito midguts) represented by read pair data in fastq format. After searching for the viral barcode in the second read, the number of usable reads for this analysis is considerably less than the original file.

## After selecting for reads with viral barcode

The script `pysam_analyze.py` iterates over the matched read pair files and outputs the extracted barcodes, their quality string, and the minimum quality of each.

```{r summarize quality html-output only, eval = knitr::is_html_output()}
reports_df %>% head() %>% knitr::kable("html", table.attr = 'class="monospace"', caption = "pysam_analyze.py output")
```

## Viral diversity

At the two top quality scores, 25 and 37, how many distinct viral barcode sequences do we see and how often do we see them?  For each plot, a single point is a distinct viral barcode, its y value is the number of reads having that barcode, and it is distinct within the groups of the plot (x-axis).

```{r viral diversity}
viral_25 <- reports_df %>% filter(min_qual_virus >= 25) %>% pull(viral) %>% table() %>% as.data.frame() %>% setNames(c("sequence", "count"))

viral_25$min_qual = 25

viral_37 <- reports_df %>% filter(min_qual_virus >= 37) %>% pull(viral) %>% table() %>% as.data.frame() %>% setNames(c("sequence", "count"))
viral_37$min_qual = 37

### Numbers for the above plots

## Deduplication and the UMI

### Background

cDNA libraries attempt to capture RNA molecules in a sample, such as mRNA transcripts produced during gene expression.  To provide enough material for sequencing, the cDNA is usually amplified by PCR, boosting the "signal" of a molecular by increasing its representation in the isolated cDNA.  The production of the RNA molecule is of biological origin. The duplication of the cDNA fragment is of technical origin.  When the goal is to count the number of molecules produced by biological means, the technical duplication should be controlled for.

The current approach is to use a unique molecular identifier (UMI), a short oligonucleotide attached to the cDNA of a biologically produced molecule *before* the amplification step.  Therefore, identical sequences which include the same UMI are assumed to come from a single molecule and are processed with software to collapse, or deduplicate, the duplicate sequences into a single observation.

In actual sequenced reads, there can be variation in the observed sequence due to sequencing errors or uncertainty in the base call.  Therefore, some ambiguity must be taken into account when deduplicating reads.  Most methods allow a small number of mismatches between UMIs if the attached sequence maps to the same place in the target genome. Therefore, with the aid of the alignment, UMIs and the read can have variation.


Given any two sequence reads, the following cases are treated this way:
- Same UMI; same sequence: single molecule duplicated by PCR
- Different UMI; same sequence: two distinct molecules generated biologically (e.g. two mRNAs transcribed from a gene)
- Different UMI; different sequence: If UMIs are close (i.e. <= 1 mismatch) AND the attached sequences map to exactly the same place via alignment, the two reads may have been a PCR duplication.
- Same UMI; different sequence: ????????????????

### Anomalous UMI-sequence combinations

Grouping by distinct combinations of UMI and payload will determine uniqueness.

Filter first by quality >= 37, then count instances after grouping by distinct UMIs.  There is no deduplication, so "occurence" includes PCR duplicate read counts.  No breakdown by yet midgut.

```{r collapse by UMI}
filtered_qual_37 <- reports_df %>% 
  filter(umi_quality >= 37 & viral_quality >= 37) %>%
  group_by(umi)

collapsed <- filtered_qual_37 %>% summarize(viral_seq = dplyr::first(viral), 
                                            distinct_viral_sequences = length(unique(viral)),
                                            n = n())

uniqueness <- table(collapsed$distinct_viral_sequences) %>% as.data.frame() %>% setNames(c("Distinct viral barcode sequences that share a UMI", "occurrence"))

# unique identifiers : unique viral sequences
n_unique = uniqueness[1,2]
# unique identifiers : multiple distinct viral sequences
n_non_unique = sum(uniqueness[[2]]) - n_unique

# get the sparse, high counts and bin them to make a more concise table
which_gte_10  = which(as.integer(uniqueness[[1]]) >= 10)
sum_gte_10 = sum(uniqueness[which_gte_10, 2])

data.frame(unique_seqs=c(uniqueness[1:10,1], ">= 10"), 
           count=c(uniqueness[1:10,2], sum_gte_10)
           ) %>%
  setNames(c("Distinct viral barcode sequences that share a UMI", "occurrence")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption="How many different viral barcodes share a distinct UMI?")
```
### Break apart by midgut
```{r break apart by midgut, cache = TRUE, include=FALSE}

# produce a tibble where midgut/umi combinations are unique (UMIs can and ARE repeated between midguts)
# calculating the consensus is more time-consuming than just taking a representative (i.e. with dplyr::first(viral))
# To calculate a consensus with N's, do: consensusString(viral, ambiguity="N")
# To calculate with IUPAC degenerate symbols, do: consensusString(viral, ambiguity = IUPAC_CODE_MAP, threshold = .25)

### Viral diversity after deduplicating 

After filtering out the anomalous cases, deduplication can be performed by collapsing exact copies of UMI:viral barcode reads into a single row in the table.  

```{r distinct viral barcodes after dedup}
non_anomalous %>%
  select(midgut, viral_seq) %>% 
  table() %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  filter(Freq > 0) %>%
  setNames(c("midgut", "sequence", "count")) -> virus_counts_by_midgut_dedup

# virus_counts_by_midgut_dedup - midgut/sequence combinations are unique
#                               `count` - number of non-anomalous observations 
#                                       of a given viral barcode within midgut
#

```

```{r top-distinct-barcodes html only, eval = knitr::is_html_output() }

## Conclusion

In this dataset, the anomalous UMI/viral barcode sequences do not provide reliable evidence that more than one virus can infect a single cell. The phenomenon occurs at the highest quality standard (37), so cannot be attributed to base calling errors in the sequencing. Until the anomaly is explained, these observations must be filtered from the analysis, leaving few cases of deduplicated reads that indicate a distinct viral origin (ranging from 0 cases to 23 in different midgut samples).  This analysis ignores some considerations. First, there may be evidence outside of the viral barcode that two distinct sequences share a UMI. If that is happening, the number of reliable counts would decrease further. Second, we did not evaluate whether this result is expected by UMI collision. However, an 11 base-pair UMI can have 4,194,304 unique sequences, far outnumbering the number of reads captured for a given cell.  In conclusion, without being able to account for distinct sequences sharing a UMI in this dataset, we are unable to reliably observe viral diversity in a cell.
